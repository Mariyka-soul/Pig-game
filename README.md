## Pig game

"Pig" is a simple dice game that involves players taking turns to roll a single die. During their turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they wish, adding up the results of each roll to their total score. However, if they happen to roll a 1, they lose all of the points they have accumulated in that turn.
